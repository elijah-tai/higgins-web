        Higgins is for teams who donâ€™t want to waste time organizing, labelling, and categorizing the tasks that they should be accomplishing, but just want to get stuff done. One person organizing all of the tasks is sufficient for the entire team to get main value out of Higgins, and group members only need to sign up if they wish to track the progress of the team themselves.
